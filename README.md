# Valley Life

## Introduction

#### About the project 
 
##### Our vision for the game so far

<p>
  Valley Life is a country life RPG where the player is dropped into an empty world with nothing more than a patch of land, a house and a trader. The game is similar to Stardew Valley or Animal Crossing in the sense that the aim of the game is to grow your farm and harvest crops which can be sold to the trader in return for more seeds or food. The player starts with 4 tools: axe, watering can, a bucket and a hoe as well as 500$ which can be used with the trader.
